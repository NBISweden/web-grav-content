# About NBIS

NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is a distributed national research infrastructure supported by the [Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr√•det)](<http://www.vr.se>), [Science for Life Laboratory](<https://www.scilifelab.se>), all major Swedish universities and the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation](<https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en>), providing state-of-the-art bioinformatics to the Swedish life science researchers community. NBIS is also the Swedish contact point to the European infrastructure for biological information [ELIXIR](<https://www.elixir-europe.org>).

Present NBIS staff has expertise in protein bioinformatics, mass spectrometry (MS), next generation sequencing (NGS), large-scale data handling and integration, metagenomics, systems biology, biostatistics and RNAseq.

NBIS is predominantly offering bioinformatics support in various projects, depending on the user needs. In the projects, the NBIS persons are working close to the research group, and they spend part of their time to teach the users in order to propagate the bioinformatics knowledge. Furthermore, NBIS provides infrastructure and tools for bioinformatics analyses in order to facilitate these analyses for the users.

NBIS forms the bioinformatics platform at the [Science for Life Laboratory](<https://www.scilifelab.se>)
