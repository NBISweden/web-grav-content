Pär worked as a software developer in the telecommunications and internet industry in the early 90s, and then moved on to study biomedicine at Uppsala University, obtained a PhD in genomics and bioinformatics from Karolinska Institutet (2007), followed by postdoctoral studies at the European Bioinformatics Institute. His past research includes studies of gene structure and organization in mammalian genomes using diverse types of RNA sequencing data, with a particular focus on discovery and functional characterization of non-protein coding RNAs; comparisons of animal genomes to identify regulatory elements and examine their evolutionary relationship to chromosomal rearrangements; and studies of transcriptional and genetic alterations in cancer using microarray and sequencing-based approaches.

Pär joined the NBIS Long-term Support (WABI) team in 2013 and has since worked extensively on characterization of genetic variants underlying human disease, as well as genome annotation based on RNA-seq and proteomics. From mid-2016, he leads the Long-term Support team together with Björn Nystedt.
