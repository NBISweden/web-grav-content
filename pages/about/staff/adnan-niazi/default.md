_email_|  adnan.niazi@nbis.se  
---|---  
  


Adnan received his PhD in bioinformatics from Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) with Erik Bongcam-Rudloff where the focus was Genome assembly and annotation. He then did a postdoc with Lars Feuk at Uppsala University, investigating schizophrenia and various aspects of transcriptomics in human brain by analyzing RNAseq data.

At NBIS, Adnan is involved with short-term bioinformatics support for next generation sequencing projects (bulk RNA-seq, small RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq), advice on project planning, experimental design and teaching on courses.
