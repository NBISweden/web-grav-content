Mun-Gwan Hong studied genetic epidemiology for his Ph.D. in the department of medical epidemiolog and biostatistics at Karolinska Institutet. After Ph.D., He worked in plasma profiling facility at SciLifeLab analysing the proteomic data. He has been involved in various omics studies, which span genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. He also developed bioinformatics/analytical tools such as ProxyGeneLD, one of first tools to convert GWAS results to gene-level for gene-set enrichment analysis (PMID=19408013). Recently, combining genomic and proteomic data, he showed an analytical approach that have possiblity to zoom-in an associated spot in a protein with a clinical trait (PMID=32737166).

Mun-Gwan is working in the short- and medium-term support team at NBIS.
