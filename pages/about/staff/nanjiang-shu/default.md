Nanjiang Shu got his PhD in Structural Chemistry from Stockholm University at 2010, majoring in protein structure prediction. Thereafter, he worked as a postdoc at the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Stockholm University. During the postdoc, he dedicated to method development of multiple sequence alignment, membrane topology prediction and study of membrane protein topology evolution.

Nanjiang Shu joined BILS in 2014, first as a bioinformatician and then as a system developer He has been working on the development of a number of protein structure prediction methods and web-tools based on cloud computing. He has also involved in the NeIC tryggve project for the the development of Federated EGA
