I work as a system developer at NBIS in Uppsala.

My background is in software development as well as in data analysis and advanced statistical methods. I got my PhD in Computational Physics at Uppsala University and my main focus was on predictive modeling, parameter optimization, statistical analysis and software development. Since then I have been working as a researcher and on development of backend APIs, scraping and databases.

I started working at NBIS in Uppsala in September 2020.
