Lokesh got his PhD in Biology at Lund University specialized in microbial genomics and ecology. During his PhD,he mainly worked with soil metagenomics and amplicon sequencing to understand how different soil management strategies affect genomic capability of microbial communities. During his postdoc in Vienna, he went further to look into the evolutionary aspects of microbes through phylogenetics and phylogenomics. During the period of his research experience, he learnt many computational techniques to understand microbial communnities from different environments through their genetic and genomic potential.
