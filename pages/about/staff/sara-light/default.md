Sara Light has a PhD in theoretical chemistry from Stockholm Bioinformatics Center. Her graduate studies primarily concerned the evolution of metabolic networks and protein-protein interaction networks. Thereafter, she worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Joint Genome Institute. There, she participated in developing a predictor of metabolic content from metagenomics and 16S rRNA sequences. During 2009 and 2011 she worked primarily on the evolution of proteins containing domain repeats, but also worked on gene finding and genome annotation in prokaryotes.

During the coming year, she will, among other things, contribute to the development annotation pipeline for proteins containing domain repeats.
