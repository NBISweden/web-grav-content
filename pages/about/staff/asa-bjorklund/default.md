Åsa received her PhD in bioinformatics from Stockholm University with Arne Elofsson where the focus was protein domain evolution. She then went on to do a post doc with Rickard Sandberg at the Karolinska Institute. There the she worked with the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data.

Åsa joined the NBIS Long Term Support in 2014 and has since then been involved in multiple transcriptomics projects and in particular many scRNAseq projects.

The main reasearch interests involves methods for analysis of single cell data, both transcriptomics and genomics data.
