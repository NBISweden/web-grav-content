Claudio has a PhD in Computer Science and Bioinformatics from University College Dublin with a thesis on Machine Learning applied to the prediction of structural features of proteins.

In 2014, Claudio became a postdoctoral researcher at Wallner lab in Linköping University, where he has focused on building complex software pipelines for the prediction and modelling of protein-protein interactions, as well as using Deep Learning techniques for the extraction of useful features from multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences.

He joined NBIS in 2019 to work in long term support with a focus on Machine Learning techniques applied to -omics data.
