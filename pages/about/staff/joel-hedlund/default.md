With a background as a Ph d and application expert in bioinformatics at the National Supercomputer Centre (NSC) at Linköping University in Sweden, Joel served as an Executive in the formative years of the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC), and was part of initiating and running its Tryggve series of projects supporting transnational research on sensitive personal biomedical data together with the Nordic nodes of ELIXIR.

Joel has since taken up a position as Data director to the Analytical Imaging Diagnostics Arena (AIDA), a collaboration arena supporting research and innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical imaging diagnostics coordinated by the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV) at Linköping University.

In this position Joel heads up the AIDA Data Hub, supporting AIDA with services for data sharing and high performance AI training on sensitive personal medical imaging data for research. Here, Joel also leads the repository infrastructure development in BIGPICTURE effort, establishing a Petabyte AI platform for European digital pathology. Joel is also the Linköping Univerity data contact to the SciLifeLab & Wallenberg national program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS).
