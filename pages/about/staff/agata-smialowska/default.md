Agata received her PhD in biology from the University of Freiburg (Germany). She was focused on small RNA and transcriptomics analyses during her post doc at the Karolinska Institute (Sweden). She also has a strong background in genetics, molecular and cell biology, which complements her experience in analysing large data sets from next generation sequencing as well as microarray experiments. Her main interest is in RNA biology and epigenetics.

At Short Term Bioinformatics Support Agata will provide bioinformatics support for next generation sequencing projects such as RNA-seq, small RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, as well as advice on project planning and experimental design.
