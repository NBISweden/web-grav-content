I have a background in computer science while I got my master’s in bioinformatics from the Uppsala University. I did my thesis, related to scRNAseq (single-cell RNA sequencing) with the Bioinformatics Long-term Support (WABI) team at NBIS. Since 2012 I have been working on various development projects as a backend developer, mainly using Python and Golang.

Joined the development team of NBIS in 2018 as a systems developer.
