## E-mail (and physical mail)

NBIS is legally part of Uppsala universitet which is a government entity. One consequence of this is that Offentlighets- och sekretesslag (SFS 2009:400) and Tryckfrihetsförordning (SFS 1949:105) govern what happens with documents created at or sent to NBIS.

## Data retention

Any data collected will be kept as long as it’s necessary for the stated purpose they are collected for.

## Your rights

You have the right to:

  1. Not be subject to decisions based solely on an automated processing of data (i.e. without human intervention) without being able to having your views taken into consideration.

  2. Request at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense, information about the personal data processed about you and the data processed.

  3. Request information to understand data processing activities when the results of these activities are applied to you (e.g. why is information collected, how do you object etc.).

  4. Request rectification of your personal data. You are also entitled to request limitation of processing your personal until rectified.

  5. Object to the processing of your personal data.

  6. Request the erasure of your personal data.

  * Comply with a legal obligation.
  * Perform a task carried out in the public interest.
  * Carry out a contractual obligation to you.
  * Perform processing based on our legitimate interest where our interest of continued processing outweighs your interest in the desired action.



### General concerning your rights

For any request, you have the right to a response as soon as possible and your request shall be handled at the latest a month after being submitted.

You are entitled to exercise your rights without charge. For repeated requests we may charge an administrative fee, but it must not be so high that it deters valid requests. As a last resort may also turn down abusive requests.

Since our host Uppsala University is a government entity you are also entitled to have your request tried in administrative court.

If you want to exercise these rights then please contact the Data Protection Officer (see How to contact us).

## How to contact us

Legally NBIS is part of the Uppsala University and therefore uses Uppsala University’s legal personality.
