# NBIS Covid19 Information

## Most is functioning as normal

Unless noted, our services should be functioning as normal. There may be minor changes - many sites have mandatory or recommended work from home policies and travel restrictions - but the core services are still being provided.

## Drop-in sessions

Drop-in sessions will be held online for all sites.

Visit [the events page](</events>) for all the information you need to join and talk to our bioinformatics experts.

## Courses and site events

For courses, we follow the recommendations and guidelines from the Swedish authorities and Folkh√§lsomyndigheten with regards to teaching and training. NBIS courses are designed to be interactive face-to-face events. However, we follow the situation carefully and will modify the delivery of the course if needed. Please check the individual training events for specific information.

Please contact [education@nbis.se](<mailto:education@nbis.se>) if you have any questions.
