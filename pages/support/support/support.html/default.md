# Support - help with analyses

We offer support for SEK800 per hour. These hours are not tied to specific days/weeks but can be spread out over several months if necessary. We only count time when our experts are actively working with your project (including meetings), compute-time is free. Support is only available if you already have data. If you are in the planning stage of your project or are waiting for data, we will instead offer a free consultation meeting.

The support we offer will be based on your needs. If you want to run the analyses yourself but need help to get started, we can give expert advice on best practices and suggest tools for you. We can be there as a discussion partner for your whole project if you like.

We can also do all the bioinformatic analyses for you. This is our most common type of support.

We have no application deadlines, projects are accepted continuously, and we strive to answer you within a working week. We make no scientific ranking of the projects we receive, and will only reject projects based on low feasibility or lack of available competence in NBIS.

When you have registered your project in our support form (see link below), a coordinator will contact you to set up a first meeting with one of our experts. Once you have agreed with the expert to what analyses should be performed, a contract will be written. This contract needs to be printed out, signed by the PI of the project, and then submitted to NBIS. The NBIS coordinator and expert will be helping you in this process. Once this is done, the support can start. When the project is ongoing you will communicate with the expert via email and/or meetings as necessary. The coordinator will also be available to support you if needed.

Please apply using the [NBIS Support Request Form](</support/supportform/index.php?form=support>).
