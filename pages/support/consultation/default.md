# Consultation - feedback on your project

We offer up to three hours of free consultation to all projects. We strongly recommend that you get in touch with us for a consultation meeting as early as possible, i.e., when you are in the planning stage of your project and before ordering data. You can also come to us if you want us to suggest a bioinformatics strategy for your grant proposal.

Usually, we will offer a meeting with a coordinator and one or more bioinformatics experts where you will get the chance to present your project. This meeting can be in person or online.

We give feedback on what data you should order to best answer your scientific questions, and give recommendations on what bioinformatics analyses to perform. We will also give you an estimate of how much time is needed for the bioinformatics analyses in case you want us to analyse your data for you.

We also offer consultation regarding various data management issues, such as writing data management plans, publishing of datasets in repositories, guidance on how to work with sensitive human data, etc. For more information please see our [Data management page](</infrastructure/data-management>).

Please apply using the [NBIS Support Request Form](</support/supportform/index.php?form=consultation>).
