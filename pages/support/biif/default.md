# BioImage Informatics

The BioImage Informatics Facility (BIIF) provides the support and training you need to perform state-of-the-art analyses on your image data. Our experts can help you deploy computational methods using computer vision, machine learning, and bioinformatics to analyze your images. Whether you are looking for training on how to use existing software solutions or help developing a custom workflow, we can help you get your analysis running.

Contact us in person, via the [support form](</support/supportform/index.php>) or write us an [email](<mailto:biif@scilifelab.se>). We usually respond fast and are always open to new ideas. You can visit us at one of our two locations: at the SciLifeLab Solna campus, or at the Centre for Image Analysis in Uppsala.
