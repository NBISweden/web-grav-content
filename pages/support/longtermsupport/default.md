# Bioinformatics Long-term Support

The Bioinformatics Long-term Support offers extensive bioinformatics support to a limited set of scientifically outstanding projects. This support has been enabled primarily by a generous grant from [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW)](<http://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en>). The idea is simple: A senior bioinformatician will work in your project 500 hours for free! Hands-on involvement by the applying research group is strictly required to ensure efficient knowledge transfer.

Curious about what we work on? Please see our [project list](<ltsprojects.html>).

## The team

The Long-term Support team has internationally competitive expert knowledge in large-scale omics data analyses. The staff are experts in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenetics, metagenomics, metabolomics, single-cell analyses and multi-omics integration, and our joint experience spans across many types of organisms and include both medical, ecological and evolutionary research. The staff currently comprise 20+ advanced applied bioinformaticians, many who have also experience in developing novel bioinformatics tools and methods. The coding skills ranges from experienced scripting to full software development. All staff are devoted full-time to bioinformatics support, and are not driving their own research careers.

## The support model

The framework of the support model is:

  * Any research group at a Swedish university can apply for support. Applications are submitted in open calls three times per year (Jan/May/Oct), and are selected based on scientific peer-review by a national Proposals Evaluation Committee (PEC).
  * Granted applications will be offered help with bioinformatics data analyses by experienced bioinformaticians for a maximum of 500h effective time. Extensions and multiple project applications are possible, but the same research group (PI) can only be granted a maximum of 1000h effective time over a period of two calendar years.
  * At least one member of the research group must be assigned to work hands-on with the data analysis alongside the Long-term Support staff to ensure transfer of know-how.
  * The support is free of charge.



The exact amount of time granted will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The Long-term Support staff will be fully integrated members of the research project during the time of the support, taking part in the scientific discussions and participating as co-authors of manuscripts according to normal contribution criteria. All work and analyses done will be fully available to the research group, including scripts and programs. Analysis tools and technical knowledge gain during the project will be made immediately public (ie before publication) unless otherwise agreed upon.

## Application criteria

Successful applications should fulfil the following main criteria

**Scientific quality**
     A scientific advisory board with national delegates will score the scientific quality of the project.
**Feasibility**
     The Long-term Support management will evaluate if the support team has the technical expertise needed to contribute to the project.
**Involvement**
     The applying party must assign at least one scientist from their group to take part in the bioinformatics work to ensure efficient knowledge transfer and longevity of the project beyond the time of the granted support.
**Data availability**
     For logistic reasons, priority will be given to projects with at least some of the data already delivered.

It is advantageous but not strictly required, that the scientist(s) assigned from the applicantâ€™s side have some experience in working in a Unix/Linux environment and/or has some previous experience in scripting. Previous knowledge in bioinformatics is not a factor in the evaluation process.

## How to apply

Applications can be submitted by filling out this form:

<https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=longterm>

Applications will be reviewed 3 times a year. Coming deadlines can be found at the application submission form above. Projects not granted support, or projects with previous support granted but in need of further assistance, are welcome to re-apply.
