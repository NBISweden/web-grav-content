# NBIS Training

NBIS offers training and workshops within the area of Bioinformatics for Life Science community across Sweden. The Training events aims towards PhD students, postdocs, investigators and other researchers within all Swedish universities. The Training events are national and have a small fee for the participants.

The educational activities cover knowledge and understanding regarding a wide range within the Bioinformatics field. We offer both introductory level activities as well as niched and advanced level activities within specialized research and/or technology areas. You can by attending our Training activities learn how to benefit from NBIS Bioinformatics expert resources and skills, how to plan your projects and how to analyse your data. The NBIS Training events are usually shorter than other educational activities and more focused on a single subject.

In addition to the more classical Training activities, NBIS offers PhD students the chance to take part of the [Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory Program](<https://www.scilifelab.se/training/the-swedish-bioinformatics-advisory-program>). This is a mentorship program where the PhD students get the unique opportunity to get a senior Bioinformatician from NBIS/SciLifeLab as a personal advisor for up to two years of their PhD studies. This call that runs yearly is a competitive call.

NBIS is also involved in the SciLifeLab Bioinformatics and Genomics Seminar Series – BiG Talks! – that is a live broadcasted event via the [SciLifeLab Youtube channel](<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWQHAK8UW0mPghV8R-Jqzg>) that aims to create networking possibilities for the SciLifeLab community and Bionformaticians and Genomics interested researchers and Staff scientists across the SciLifeLab nodes in Sweden. The BiG Talks! seminar series is to be given 4 times per year at different SciLifeLab nodes across Sweden. Please check the NBIS event page or the SciLifeLab website for current information.

NBIS is offering Tailor-made training events – courses/workshops that are tailored to your specific needs and audience. For instance, we can offer hands-on training assistance in a number of focused research areas (please see our staff pages or contact us for further details). We could in discussions with you set-up a curriculum covering your chosen group of participants need and provide expert Bioinformaticians as teacher for the event. The cost for such activities is the same as for Support (see <https://nbis.se/support/support.html> for updated fees), where the cost for planning, setting-up the event, travels and the event on site is included in the budget plan.

Please note that NBIS training events do not provide any formal university credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before submitting a course application in order to establish whether the course is valid for formal credits or not.
