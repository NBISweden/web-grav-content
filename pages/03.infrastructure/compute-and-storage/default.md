# NBIS Compute and Storage

The Bioinformatics compute and storage facility provides high-performance computing and storage resources, maintain relevant bioinformatics software and data (e.g. reference genomes), and offer associated user support. The facility is hosted at Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (SNIC-UPPMAX), which is Uppsala University’s resource for high-performance computing and related know-how. Its reference group makes strategic and policy decisions, while a manager is responsible for daily operations.

## Services

**Bioinformatics software**
     Maintenance of an extensive suite of bioinformatics software applications. Assistance with installation and updates
**Computing and storage**
     High-performance computing and large-scale storage for bioinformatics, primarily for the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) community in Sweden
**Hardware and system administration**
     Expert management of high-performance computational hardware
**Reference data**
     Maintenance of reference genomes and other shared data sources
**Training services**
     Participates in various SciLifeLab workshops and courses, such as “Computational Methods for Massively Parallel Sequencing”. Provides computational resources for several other courses
**User support**
     Provides technical user support for high-performance computing and NGS analyses on UPPNEX systems

## Equipment

**Access to SweStore National Storage**
     Mainly for archiving data for longer periods of time.
**Alignment programs**
