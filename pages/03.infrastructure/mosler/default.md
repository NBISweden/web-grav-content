# Mosler

![Mosler](/assets/img/mosler.png) The Mosler secure computing environment enables scientists to carry out research on _sensitive data_ , e.g. personal data relating to health, in accordance with the [Personal Data Act](<http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/87382a7887764e9995db186244b557e4/personal-data-protection>).

The project is owned and managed by NBIS.

## System Description

The Mosler system is based on the Norwegian system [TSD 2.0](<https://www.usit.uio.no/prosjekter/tsd20/>), developed at the [University Centre for IT (USIT)](<http://www.usit.uio.no/>) at the [University of Oslo (UiO)](<http://www.uio.no/>). The basic layout of the system is a secure centralised service at [Uppsala University](<http://www.uu.se/>) where data are stored. Within the secure environment a High Performance Computing (HPC) resource is provided for large jobs. All projects on the system will have their own set of virtual machines (VM). Users access their VM via a secured graphical terminal using two-factor authentication, and all communication is encrypted. This way the data is controlled and secured in the central secure vault and the risk of losing data is minimized. The environment is secured by a strict firewall and no internet access is allowed within the environment.

Import and export is handled by a secured file transfer service. Only project Principal Investigators are allowed to export data from the secured system.

## Getting Access

Access to Mosler can be obtained by submitting an application in [SNIC SUPR](<https://supr.snic.se/>), see more info on the [Mosler support pages](<moslerdoc/support.html>).

## Acknowledgements in publications

NBIS would be grateful if you acknowledge the use of the Mosler system in publications according to this example: “ _Support by NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) for the use of the Mosler system for sensitive data is gratefully acknowledged._ ”

## Tryggve project

Mosler is a building-block in the [Tryggve](<https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Tryggve>) project that is working to establish a Nordic platform for collaboration on sensitive data, and that is funded by NeIC and the ELIXIR nodes in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.

The project welcomes **use-cases** from researchers collaborating on sensitive data with researchers in other Nordic countries. Please follow instructions on the [Tryggve Getting Started page](<https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Tryggve_Getting_Started>).

As part of the NBIS engagement in Tryggve, NBIS is committed to the [Tryggve Code of Conduct](</assets/doc/TryggveCodeofConduct.pdf>).
