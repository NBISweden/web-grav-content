Daniel Lundin has a PhD in molecular biology with an emphasis on molecular evolution from Stockholm University. As a PhD student Daniel was involved in phylogenetic and other evolutionary analyses of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. As a postdoc, Daniel has been involved in environmental genomics, including metagenomics and amplicon based diversity analyses. Before his PhD period, Daniel was working as a consulting database developer.

Daniel is an expert in phylogenetics, sequence analyses such as HMMER and high performance bioinformatics computing. Biological applications focus on environmental genomics including amplicon based diversity research, frequency oriented analyses based on metagenomic reads and assembly of metagenomes.
