Paulo received his PhD in Immunology and Parasitology from the Federal University of Uberlandia (Brazil) in 2015. His work focused on understanding inflammatory mechanisms against protozoan pathogen _Toxoplasma gondii_ for diagnosis and vaccine development purposes.

He soon started his PostDoc at Karolinska Institutet in 2015, investigating the molecular mechanism of colonic inflammation in a time-series RNA-seq manner in both mice and humans. His work involved deep understanding of the immune system, wet-lab experimental designs as well as several analysis methods: RNA-seq, scRNAseq, transcriptomics, Proximity Extension Assay (PEA), microbiome profiling, Flow cytometry (FACS), image analysis (image J), high- thoughput qPCR, among others.

Paulo joined the NBIS long-term support team in Stockholm in 2018. His current research interests are single-cell transcriptomics, integrative omics, system biology and big-data visualization.
