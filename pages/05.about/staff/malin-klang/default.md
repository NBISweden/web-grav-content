I work as a system developer in Uppsala, mainly doing backend programming.

I have previously studied Computer Science at Gothenburg university, with a focus on natural language processing, algorithms and logic. In 2012 I started working as a system developer at Språkbanken (the Swedish Language Bank) in Gothenburg, participating in both research projects (eg. computational morhpology, NLP for historical Swedish) as well as in pure system development projects. I started working at NBIS in Uppsala in 2018.
