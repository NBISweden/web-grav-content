Per Unneberg earned his PhD in molecular biotechnology at the Royal Instintute of Technology, Stockholm, where he focused on developing methods for analysing short cDNA sequencing tags. He has done a postdoc in Marseilles, working on large-scale analyses of sequence databases, followed by a postdoc at Karolinska Institutet where he worked on the genetics of complex diseases.

Per joined the NBIS Long Term Support in 2014 after having spent two years in the SciLifeLab sequencing core facility.

His main research interest focuses on molecular evolution, reproducible research, statistics, genomics, and RNA sequence analysis.

He is located at SciLifeLab Uppsala.
