Sebastian is a computational biologist with a background in proteomics, molecular biology, and virology. He received a Ph.D. at the Karolinska Institutet, conducting research on the topic of host-pathogen interactions and the emerging field of degradomics. After completing his Ph.D., he joined as a postdoctoral researcher the National Emerging Infectious Disease Laboratories (NEIDL) at Boston University. His postdoctoral work focused on using system-level biology approaches (transcriptomics and proteomics) in combination with experimental methods to study endogenous proteases in the context of the innate immune response. In 2020 he returned to Sweden and joined the short-and-medium term support team at NBIS as a bioinformatician specialising in the area of proteogenomics.
