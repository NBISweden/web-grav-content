###  Bengt Sennblad NBIS expert

_omics integration, reproducible research, probabilistic modeling, algorithmics, genetic interactions, genetic associations studies, genome evolution_

Bengt has PhD in Biology from Uppsala University and a Associate professorship (‘Docentur’) in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH. During his time as Assistant professor at the Stockholm Bioinformatics Center (SBC), he initiated an ongoing collaborative project aimed at modeling genome evolution; this resulted in the first probabilistic gene evolution model integrating gene duplication and loss, lateral transfer and sequence evolution. He has also worked in the field of medical genetics of complex diseases at Karolinska Institutet, developing statistical methods for studying interactions in genome-wide association studies and providing bioinformatics expertise to local projects, as well as internationl consortia aimed at cardiovascular disease studies. Bengt joined the NBIS long-term support facility in 2015. His research interest includes in methods for integrated analysis of data from several different omics sources, reproducible research, genetics analysis, genomic evolution and method development.
