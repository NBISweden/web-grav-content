I work as a system developer in Stockholm.

I have Master of Science in Industrial Engineering and Management, specialization Software Intensive Systems, at The Faculty of Engineering at Lund University (LTH). I finished my thesis 2019 where I focused on how to assess security vulnerabilities of web servers through configuration analysis. I have worked as a backend developer at both startups and large companies. Python, Java, SQL, Neo4j, Docker, aws, RabbitMQ are some of the languages/ technologies I have previously worked with.
