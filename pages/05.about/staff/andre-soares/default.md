André has a background in evolutionary biology and phylogenetics, with a PhD in genetics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Paleogenomics Lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he was trained in ancient DNA/paleogenomics, participating in many projects involving data generation and genomic analyses of ancient populations of multiple species. He worked at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing of Brazil as a fellow postdoctoral researcher focused on genome assembly of Brazilian birds, and also as a researcher at the Human Evolution Program of Uppsala University, working on ancient DNA and population genomics of ancient domesticated sheep. He is joining, as an expert, the NBIS Genome Assembly and Annotation Team in late 2021.
