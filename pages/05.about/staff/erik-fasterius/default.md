Erik Fasterius earned his PhD in biotechnology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology working with high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics. He was focused on variant analyses of RNA sequencing data and its applications on model systems for cancer research, but he also has experience with whole genome sequencing, software and pipeline development, as well as machine learning. He also has a flair for the visual and enjoys presenting data in informative and appealing ways.

At NBIS, Erik is working one of SciLifeLabs Technology Development Projects with the creation of a bioinformatic pipeline for a novel RNA sequencing-based method. He also provides support for short- and medium-term projects, as well as teach on NBIS courses. Erik is located at SciLifeLab Stockholm.
