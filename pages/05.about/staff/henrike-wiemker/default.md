I am a system developer at SciLifeLab in Uppsala and mainly focus on frontend development. Thus, a lot of my work is done in JavaScript and its frameworks.

I switched career to work as a developer by doing a boot camp for frontend development in 2020/2021 and started working at NBIS right after that.

Earlier, I worked as a science journalist which even is my academical background. I have a master’s degree in science journalism from TU Dortmund University in Germany and worked for national media in both Germany in Sweden for several years.
