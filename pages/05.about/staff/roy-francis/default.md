###  Roy Francis NBIS expert

_experimental design, RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, Infinium methylation arrays, GATK variant-calling, R programming, data visualisation_

_email_|  roy.francis@nbis.se

I am involved with the short-term bioinformatics support for next generation sequencing projects (bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq) as well as Infinium methylation array analyses. In addition, I work with project planning, experimental design, R programming. I support with teaching activities on the Introduction to Bioinformatics course, RNA-Seq analyses course, RaukR (Advanced R for Bioinformatics) and others.

I received my PhD in Agroecology from Aarhus University, Denmark for work on viral diagnostics, transmission and epidimeology in the European honey bee using molecular techniques such as qPCR. I then worked on population structure and spatial genetics of honey bees as a research associate. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University, on ‘Consequences of haploid selection in Zebrafish’. This work included confocal microscopy, image analysis, flow cytometry and RNA-Seq analysis on experimentally selected fish.
