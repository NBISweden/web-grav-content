I have a PhD in biological mass spectrometry from [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences](<https://www.slu.se>) where I focused on quantitative LC-MS analysis of paralogous proteins in plants.

At NBIS I’ll be working with cloud services such as deployments in Openstack and Kubernetes environments for the Swedish Local EGA solution. As part of the [Tryggve Project](<https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Tryggve>).

I’m currently located at [Computational Life Science Cluster](<http://www.kbc.umu.se/english/clic/>) at [Umeå University](<http://www.umu.se>).
