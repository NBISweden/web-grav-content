Olga has a PhD in bioinformatics from the University of Birmingham, UK. She is interested in turning omics data into knowledge, especially in the context of clinical research and precision medicine.

Over the years Olga has worked on a series of projects at the intersection of bioinformatics and statistics, across many data types, both within methods development and applications. During her PhD studies, she has worked with mass-spectrometry based metabolomics to optimize handling of missing data and to improve the outcomes of liver transplantations. As a medical statistician at the University of Oxford she was involved in methodological studies addressing visual search strategies in cancer diagnostics and as a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institute, she was developing omics integration methods to identify novel driver genes in cancer.

At NBIS Olga provides bioinformatics support for a wide range of next generation sequencing projects with a focus on transcriptomics data whitin clinical research. She enjoyes sharing the knowledge and is involved in many teaching activities, in particular co-organizes Introduction to Biostatisics and Machine Learning course.
