Vincent studied at the KULeuven in Belgium, where he obtained a Master’s degree in Biology, followed by a Master in Bioinformatics. After a PhD in Molecular Biology at the same university, he went on to do a postdoc in the Ola Larsson group at the Department of Oncology-Pathology department at Karolinska Institute. Using RNA-seq, he studied the regulation of mRNA translation in cancer on a genome-wide scale. Thereafter, he moved to the Center for Cancer Biology at the VIB (Flemish Institute for Biotechnology), where he managed the bioinformatics support center. In this function, he offered support to multiple research groups on a wide range of bioinformatics issues including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, variant analysis, pathway analysis, exploration and integration of public databases (e.g. GEO and TCGA), high-throughput siRNA and CRISPR screens and the visualization and statistical analysis of data.

At NBIS, Vincent offers short-term support, mostly focused on the different flavors of NGS, including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, and the downstream analyses used to interpret these kinds of data.
