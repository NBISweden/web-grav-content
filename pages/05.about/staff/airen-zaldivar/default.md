I am a system developer working at the ScilifeLab, doing backend programming. I mainly have experience with Java and Python. I studied Computer Science at the Havana university (2001-2007) and then worked in Cuba for three years. In 2010 I moved to Spain. There, I did a master degree in Biophysics and I worked at the National Center for Biotechnology (CNB) for several years. At the CNB I contributed to the development of Scipion, an image processing framework to obtain 3D models of macromolecular complexes using Electron Microscopy. In 2017 I moved to Sweden. Here in Stockholm I have being working at ArkivIT as a consultant, until the end of 2018, when I went on parental leave. I started working at the NBIS in Stockholm in 2020.
