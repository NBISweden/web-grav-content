###  [ELIXIR launches new projects to implement 2019-2023 Scientific Programme](<> "Permalink for ELIXIR launches new projects to implement 2019-2023 Scientific Programme")

ELIXIR has launched 28 new projects to implement the Scientific Programme for 2019-2023. These projects bring together technical experts across all ELIXIR Nodes and connect people and services across Europe into a federated infrastructure for life-science data. Collectively they strengthen ELIXIRâ€™s portfolio of bioinformatics services and develop new strategic services to address existing bottlenecks in working with life science data.

ELIXIR Sweden is involved in several projects, e.g. [Data Integration for Compute](<https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/data-integration>), [FAIR Service Architecture](<https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/fair-service-architecture>), [ELIXIR Federated Human Data](<https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/federated-human-data>), and [Gap analysis, training materials development and training delivery](<https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/gap-analysis>).
