The [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](<https://www.sib.swiss/>) and [NBIS/SciLifeLab Sweden](<https://nbis.se>) are pleased to announce a joint Autumn School in **Single Cell Analysis**.

This special event will take place 13-18 October 2019 in Leysin, a nice all-season resort in the Swiss Alps. This school aims at training students and young researchers in cutting-edge methodologies about single cell analysis in the various omics. With a mix of lectures and hands-on sessions, supervised by expert speakers / tutors, and in a nice environment and atmosphere, we are convinced that this School will meet your expectations.
