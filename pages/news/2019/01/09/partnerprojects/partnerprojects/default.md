###  [New bioinformatics support service: Partner Projects](<> "Permalink for New bioinformatics support service: Partner Projects")

In order to provide a full range of bioinformatics services to our user community, NBIS is now introducing **Partner Projects** , a support service for projects requiring NBIS support staff of at least 12 person months over the project life-time.

Partner projects are preferably discussed and agreed upon before a project applies for funding from a funding agency, with NBIS salary costs specified in the proposed budget (and possibly with NBIS as a co-applicant in the proposal, if applicable).

More information and application instructions [here](</support/partnerprojects.html>).
