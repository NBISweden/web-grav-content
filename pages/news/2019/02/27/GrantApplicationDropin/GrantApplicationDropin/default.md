###  [Boost your VR application!](<> "Permalink for Boost your VR application!")

# Preparing your grant application? Visit our free consultation drop-in!

NBIS and friends are organising free consultation drop-in sessions to discuss bioinformatics, sequencing and data issues for the upcoming grant applications! SciLifeLab staff will be present on site, but also stand-by online to try to cover as many topics as possible. Soon at a university near you!

Meet our bioinformatics experts and sequencing coordinators to discuss new technology updates, input on your study design, opportunities for bioinformatics support, and guidance on the new data management plans.
