###  [1+Million Genomes Survey for researchers](<> "Permalink for 1+Million Genomes Survey for researchers")

The 1+Million Genomes Initiative (1+MG) aims to enable access to at least 1 million sequenced genomes in the EU by 2022 in order to fully leverage the potential of genomics in the prevention, diagnostics, and therapy of cancer, non-communicable diseases, rare diseases, and infectious diseases – for the benefit of our citizens and patients, health care systems, and research and innovation infrastructure. Sweden is together with 22 other European countries engaged in 1+MG since 2018.

Currently, the 1+MG project is doing a survey aiming to understand what existing genomic datasets and corresponding phenotypic/clinical information are effectively available for participation in the 1+MG. It should also help to understand what are the challenges and bottlenecks for sharing, and how they may be overcome by development of technical or policy solutions. The answers will be analysed to make recommendations for the design of a European framework for sharing genomic and associated clinical data, develop solutions to overcome challenges, and also to provide guidance for participation in the 1+MG initiative.

We would therefore encourage all Swedish research groups with WGS/WES data to complete the [survey](<https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/1plusMG_Survey2020>) (even if you do not have ethical approval to share data), which is available on the European Commission’s EU Survey platform: <https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/1plusMG_Survey2020>.
