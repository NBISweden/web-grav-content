###  [COVID19 efforts](<> "Permalink for COVID19 efforts")

With regards to the current covid-19 situation there is a tremendous amount of effort starting accross the world. As NBIS is the Swedish node of ELIXIR we would like to highlight the following initiatives to support research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus:

  * [ELIXIR resources collection](<https://elixir-europe.org/covid-19-resources>)
  * [ELIXIR services to support COVID19 research](<https://elixir-europe.org/news/covid-19-support>)



We also want to showcase [the efforts at SciLifeLab](<https://www.scilifelab.se/covid-19>).

Some other noteworthy resource collections are the [EMBL-EBI COVID19 portal](<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/covid-19>) as well as [GISAID](<https://www.gisaid.org/>).
