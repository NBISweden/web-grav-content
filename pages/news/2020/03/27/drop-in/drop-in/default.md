###  [NBIS Bioinformatic drop-in - Now Online!](<> "Permalink for NBIS Bioinformatic drop-in - Now Online!")

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic NBIS popular Bioinformatic drop-in sessions can no longer be face-to-face. To continue making bioinformatics support accessible to life science researchers in this time we have therefore moved it online! Each of our sites, Lund, Linköping, Uppsala, Stockholm, Umeå and Gothenburg, host a session each week using Zoom. For times and a link to join the meeting, please visit [www.nbis.se/events](<www.nbis.se/events>).
