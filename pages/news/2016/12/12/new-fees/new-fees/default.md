###  [New NBIS user fees from Jan 1st 2017](<> "Permalink for New NBIS user fees from Jan 1st 2017")

In order to simplify administration and to comply with requirements from our funders, the NBIS support service will not provide any free support; all support is charged for with the user fee of 800 SEK per hour.

Bioinformatics consultations and long-term support services are not affected by this decision.

This change is effective Jan 1st 2017. Projects up to number 3573 do get their initial free hours, since they have already been initiated.
