###  [Welcome to NBIS](<> "Permalink for Welcome to NBIS")

Welcome to NBIS – National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden – the successor of BILS which starts now in April 2016. NBIS includes also WABI (Wallenberg Advanced Bioinformatics Infrastructure), SILS (Systems Biology Infrastructure for Life Sciences) and the SciLifeLab Bioinformatics Platform.

NBIS thereby has all types of bioinformatics support within one organisation, facilitating user contacts and enabling more efficient service provision. We are very much looking forward to help you with various bioinformatics analyses.

Bengt Persson, director
