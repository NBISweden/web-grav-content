###  [Swedish National Research School in Medical Bioinformatics](<> "Permalink for Swedish National Research School in Medical Bioinformatics")

There is a new initiative in bioinformatics training, the Swedish National Research School in Medical Bioinformatics. The school is aimed at PhD students who just started (or will start soon) with an interest in medical bioinformatics. The research school is backed by a large group of bioinformaticians from all the major universities in Sweden. The school will be jointly coordinated by four scientists working at SciLifeLab in Stockholm.

For the first year the target audience is students who start(ed) their PhD studies between Jan 2016 and April 2017. Application deadline will be **Feb 28 2017**.
