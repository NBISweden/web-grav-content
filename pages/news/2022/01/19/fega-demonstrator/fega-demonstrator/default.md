###  [Federated EGA End to End demonstrator](<> "Permalink for Federated EGA End to End demonstrator")

Together with the [Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG)](<https://www.crg.eu/>) in Spain and the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)](<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/>) in the UK, NBIS has just successfully finished an end-to-end test of the [Swedish node](<https://nbis.se/infrastructure/sensitive-data-archive.html>) for the [Federated EGA](<https://ega-archive.org/federated>). A resource that will enable GDPR-compliant sharing of large volumes of sensitive research data.

The end-to-end test was performed as a role play where we worked through all the steps needed for successful submission, data access request and data delivery. The user-roles involved where submitter, data access committee and data requestor, we also had roles assigned for helpdesk in NBIS, helpdesk in Central EGA, technical operator in NBIS and technical operator in Central EGA.

At the same time [CSC](<https://www.csc.fi/en/home>) in Finland also performed their demonstrator and we now join [Elixir Norway](<https://elixir.no/>) as nodes that are ready to participate in the Federated EGA. We are now confident that we have all the procedures in place to start operating the Swedish Federated EGA node.

Currently we are laying the final touches to the legal framework for the federation and then we should soon be ready to go.
