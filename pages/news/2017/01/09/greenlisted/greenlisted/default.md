###  [Green Listed - a CRISPR Screen Tool](<> "Permalink for Green Listed - a CRISPR Screen Tool")

[Green Listed](<http://greenlisted.cmm.ki.se/>) is a tool facilitating the rapid design of custom CRISPR screens. It is used to mine publicly available source lists/reference libraries of gRNAs to design custom libraries targeting genes specified by the user, such as all kinases or all genes up-regulated in an RNAseq experiment.

[Green Listed](<http://greenlisted.cmm.ki.se/>) was developed by the [Wermeling Lab](<https://wermelinglab.com/>) at [Karolinska Institutet](<http://ki.se>), with assistance from NBIS.
