###  [Calls: SciLifeLab National Projects](<> "Permalink for Calls: SciLifeLab National Projects")

[SciLifeLab](<https://www.scilifelab.se>) now has two open calls for Swedish research projects based on next generation DNA sequencing. One call is for whole genome sequencing to identify genetic causes of disease, the other for using sequencing to reveal genetic variation in nature.

The Swedish Genomes Program and the Swedish Biodiversity Program have been running since 2014 with the support from the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation](<https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en>).

Application deadline: June 15, 2017.

For more information and application instructions, see [SciLifeLab National Projects](<https://www.scilifelab.se/research/national-projects/>).
