###  [Call: Bioinformatics Long-term Support](<> "Permalink for Call: Bioinformatics Long-term Support")

One of the national services offered by NBIS is [Bioinformatics Long-term support](</support/longtermsupport.html>) (a.k.a. WABI) in next generation sequencing and related omics. We offer a senior bioinformatician to work in your project for up to 500 hours. The support is fully subsidized and free of charge, but extensive hands-on involvement is required by the applying research groups. Note that a part of this call will focus on early involvement in integrative omics projects, see below.

Projects are selected based on their scientific quality, and the deadline for the next round of applications to be reviewed by the national evaluation committee is **FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 15th, 2017 (24:00)**.

Applications are welcome for projects

  * anywhere in Sweden
  * any type of NGS application as well as other large-scale omics
  * any bioinformatics skills



The decision on what projects get support in this call will be taken in late October/early November 2017. Typically, about 5-10 projects are granted support in each application round.

In addition to the regular projects, we also aim to grant support to an additional 1-3 projects with a clear focus on data integration, which can be subject to more extensive method development support. Beside scientific merits, these projects preferably combine multiple omics technologies and include methodological challenges of general interest.

To apply for support, you need to submit a small application about your project.
