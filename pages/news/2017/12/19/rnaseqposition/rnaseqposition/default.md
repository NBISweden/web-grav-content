###  [Open position: Bioinformatician in RNA-seq based gene expression](<> "Permalink for Open position: Bioinformatician in RNA-seq based gene expression")

NBIS is now looking for a new member to support Swedish researchers in transcriptomics, in particular in RNA-seq based expression studies. The position is at Uppsala University in the creative environment of the SciLifeLab Uppsala node “The Hub”. Here more than 30 bioinformaticians and developers as well as core facilities and many different research groups are interacting. The Hub is the perfect place to grow as a bioinformatician with plenty of discussion partners always being available and also courses and seminars regularly being offered.

We are looking for an expert with a strong background in gene expression studies, in particular RNA-seq, but experience from array-based studies is also of interest. The work will focus on supporting Swedish researchers in this field under a “fee for service”-model. The projects will differ in complexity and can involve any organisms, including human/mouse but also non-model organisms. Responsibilities include running analyses, communication with clients, staying aware of current developments in the field, writing reports, and some teaching.

The position is available as soon as possible for a period of one year with eventual possibility to extension.

**Application Deadline:** January 15, 2018
