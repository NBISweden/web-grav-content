###  [BiG Talks - Bioinformatics and Genomics Seminar Series](<> "Permalink for BiG Talks - Bioinformatics and Genomics Seminar Series")

Arranged by the SciLifeLab platforms for Bioinformatics, Genomics and Diagnostics Development

The Bioinformatics and Genomics seminar series (“BiG Talks”) is a new initiative arranged by the SciLifeLab platforms for Bioinformatics (NBIS), Genomics (NGI) and Diagnostics Development. The seminar series aims to give inspiration to the SciLifeLab community and to create new networking possibilities. The BiG Talks will rotate between different SciLifeLab nodes and the aim is to have these seminars four times a year. Also, each event will be live broadcasted at the [SciLifeLab YouTube channel](<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWQHAK8UW0mPghV8R-Jqzg>) for people outside the different sites to be able to join in. Help in disseminating this information by printing our [BiG Talks flyer](</assets/doc/big-talks-flyer1.pdf>) is greatly appreciated.

The first BiG Talk event will take place at SciLifeLab Uppsala (Trippelrummet, Navet) on **June 11th** and we welcome everyone that are interested in Bioinformatics and Genomics to join in.

After the seminar (around 11.30) a lunch sandwich will be served for those who are registered for the event. During the lunch there will be a chance to mingle with the speaker and bioinformaticians and other interested people in the seminar topics. Also, we would like to hear your feedback for the BiG Talk initiative to make this seminar series as successful as possible. Please follow [this link](<https://goo.gl/forms/e4ZbBHBURHOtWyqW2>) to register for the lunch sandwich for the Uppsala seminar 11th of June (deadline 6th of June).
