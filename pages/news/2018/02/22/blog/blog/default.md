###  [Welcome to the NBIS blog](<> "Permalink for Welcome to the NBIS blog")

Dear all,

Welcome to the new blog of [NBIS](<https://nbis.se/>) – the Swedish national bioinformatics infrastructure! Here, we will – with a bioinformatics touch – communicate and discuss news of interest for life scientists, especially in the area of large-scale analysis in genomics, proteomics and other omics disciplines. Other topics include analytical work flows and useful tools. We will use this as an additional information channel to tell you about activities in NBIS and [Elixir](<https://www.elixir-europe.org/>) – the European infrastructure for life science data.

**<https://nbis.se/blog>**

We also plan to invite guest bloggers from neighbouring areas. We hope that you will find the blog posts interesting and that you will spread those that you find valuable in your networks. We expect that the new NBIS blog will lead to increased contacts with all our users!

Once again: Very welcome!

Bengt Persson, director of NBIS
