###  [Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory program - Application open!](<> "Permalink for Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory program - Application open!")

The application to join the Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory Program for 2019-2020 is now open! This is a unique opportunity where PhD students can get a senior bioinformatician from NBIS/SciLifeLab as a personal advisor for up to two years of their PhD studies.

More information and application instructions [here](<https://www.scilifelab.se/education/mentorship/the-swedish-bioinformatics-advisory-program/>).

**Deadline:** December 20, 2018.

Note that this is a competitive call; last year we had more than 90 applicants for 15 spots. Clear and consise descriptions of projects, data and motivations are important. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the program, competence match to the available bioinformatics staff, the competence of the PhD student, as well as gender and geographical balance. Experience in working with Unix/Linux, as well as basic scripting skills, are strong merits.
