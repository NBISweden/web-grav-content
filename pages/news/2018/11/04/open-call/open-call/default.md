###  [Open announcement for additional national NBIS services](<> "Permalink for Open announcement for additional national NBIS services")

For the future development of NBIS, we hereby invite proposals for additional bioinformatics services that would be valuable for the national life science community. These will be funded for up to two years with possible extension. The service could be expertise or infrastructure component(s) or a combination of both. Examples of areas from previous open announcements are proteomics, phylogenomics, and protein structure prediction servers.

Deadline: **12 December 2018**
