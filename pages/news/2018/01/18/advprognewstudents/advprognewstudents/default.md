###  [Huge interest to join the Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory Program!](<> "Permalink for Huge interest to join the Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory Program!")

[The Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory Program](<https://www.scilifelab.se/education/mentorship/the-swedish-bioinformatics-advisory-program/>) offers bioinformatics mentoring to PhD students during a 2-year period from a personal NBIS staff advisor. The program has been much appreciated, and this year attracted a huge interest with almost 100 PhD students across Sweden applying to join the program! The students are selected in an open competitive call, limited by the availability of our current staff. 12 new students from across 6 universities have now been accepted to the program for 2018/2019, and we are looking forward to welcome them to the NBIS/SciLifeLab bioinformatics community!

The next call for students will open at the end of 2018.

For questions about the program, please contact bjorn.nystedt@scilifelab.se
